## Engineering biocatalytic systems for sustainable chemical manufacturing

We develop enzyme-based technologies that enable efficient, scalable, and sustainable chemical processes, spanning biocatalysis, enzyme immobilisation, and flow bioprocess engineering.

### Research themes
- Biocatalysis and enzyme engineering  
- Enzyme immobilisation and materials  
- Flow bioprocessing and reactor design
